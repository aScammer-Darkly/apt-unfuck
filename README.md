# apt-unfuck

> Because sometimes `apt` gets real dumb, real fast.

**apt-unfuck** is a surgical recovery script designed to fix stuck, broken, or mid-wedgie `apt`/`dpkg`/`aptitude` installs — without nuking the entire box.

---

## 🧠 What It Does

- Kills stuck `apt`, `apt-get`, `aptitude`, or `dpkg` processes
- Removes lockfiles that are blocking your install/update
- Attempts to auto-recover with `dpkg --configure -a`
- Leaves you with a clean slate and a smoldering `/var/lib`
